abstract: Data Management offers opportunities to move beyond paper and pencil analysis. By focusing student’s attention on data/statistical literacy, data collection, and manipulation and interpretation, teachers can engage students who typically find algebra-based math class inaccessible. Fathom, Excel, and web resources will allow your students to manage their learning in a variety of settings. This presentation will provide you with resources to build your class’s own data sets using Google Sheets, discuss the use of the flipped classroom and EDpuzzle, describe collecting data for projects using Statistics Canada (or other sites), and discuss having students create instructional videos and complete projects as ongoing assignments. We’ll also discuss how using conversations, observations and checklists to assess student understanding can be beneficial and practical, and how using online discussion forums to structure knowledge creation environments for students will allow your class to make connections to real-life topics. Feel free to bring your own device to try a few of these resources in real time.
