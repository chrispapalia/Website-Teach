abstract: It is time that we start integrating our Data Management and AP Statistics classes with the fields of Data Science and Computing. In university, students will be expected to perform their data analysis and statistics using statistical computing software. Giving our students an opportunity to learn probability and statistics by doing data science will teach students the essential statistical skills we want with the added benefit of learning computational thinking and coding. You will be surprised how frictionless the initial set up is using RStudio Cloud and how easily students learn how to produce visualization and manage data in the RStudio Cloud IDE. Bring your laptop to participate in this interactive workshop that will inspire you to use this in your next class. I will also provide a variety of resources including a free e-text that uses R for its examples and lab activities. Additionally, you will be introduced to the R for Data Science Online Learning Community and the vast network of professionals who are willing to support and help you and your students learn to use R. I will also share my own experience learning to use R, a free opensource software program
